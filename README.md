# EXOTIC CROSSHAIR

### IMPORTANT: ONLY CHANGE THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CODE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING!!!
### ALSO U WILL NEED TO RECOMPILE THE PROJECT TO APPLY THE CODE YOU CHANGE

### THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO NOT USER FRIENDLY. YOU WILL NEED THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF C++ TO CHANGE THE CODE SUCH AS THE CROSSHAIR SIZE. (still better than crosshairX  lol)

### DO NOT REUPLOAD THIS BECAUSE IM JUST A SMALL CODER CODING FOR FUN AND DO NOT
### WANT TO BE CONFUSED WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS!!! EXONL IS THE ORIGINAL ONE WHO MADE THIS PROGRAM

### TO CHANGE ANY CODE OF THE PROGRAM SUCH AS THE CROSSHAIR SIZE U WILL NEED TO HAVE A C++ COMPILER SUCH AS CLANG, GCC OR G++ WHICH IS COMPATIBLE
### WITH CMAKE!!!




## INFO:
Thank you for choosing this Crosshair program even tho I get nothing from it!
I just made it for fun lol.
Anyways, People who buy CrosshairX are just brainwashed because if they learn stuff like GLFW then making
a crosshair program like CrosshairX is just easy as fuck. I dont get why people would fall for this shit.
Btw I got the standard crosshair png from https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-njyuj if u need it.


## HOW IT WORKS:
Im using C++ and the GLFW(openGL Framework library) for the rendering and window.
I made the window unmovable, transparent and show over every other program n stuff.
I mean who tf pays for CrosshairX if u can get a even better program like this where u can do everything like in CrosshairX.
Im also using the STBI library to get the texture of the crosshair also!
Dont get scammed kids!

## TUTORIAL:

To change the crosshair image simply take any picture u want as a crosshair and name it exactly " crosshair.png " and it is only PNG compatible!

Changing the size of the crosshair is something much harder to do as you will need to change the code for it and also u will need to have a c++ compiler such as
the headers/includes: GLFW, gl.h and stb_image.h to be able to compile it correctly.
Basically this shit is not really for gamers who just want a crosshair. This is more likely for C++ programmers with the basic knowledge of c++ needed.

Anyways to change the code for a bigger crosshair, simply adjust the value from "crosshairSize" at line 18 of the "main.cpp" file.

### This crosshair program is may not useful for gamers but it still got all the things a functional crosshair program needs.
